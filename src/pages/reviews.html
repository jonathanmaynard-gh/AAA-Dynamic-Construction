"I have known Mike Sakkestad for a long time and have seen his work. I can only say it’s amazing - quality and aesthetic! Especially so is the house he built in Scott’s Valley. I’ve seen him work on items like a sink till he got it right. He doesn’t cut corners and us high standards for acceptable price. Highly recommend!"

        "Mike was fantastic to work with. I used him on 3 projects and they all ran smoothly with no unresolved issues. He takes responsibility for all sub-contractors that work under his supervision and I appreciated that very much!"

        "Mike Sakkestad (AAA Dynamic Contruction Inc.) helped us to remodel our home at 13666 Verde Vista Court in Saratoga. Overall we are extremely pleased with the outcome. It is a smoothly run project and as the result, a beautifully remodeled home. We bought this home in Summer 2010 and decided to do a significant internal update. We interviewed nearly ten general contractors and finally selected Mike based on his reasonable pricing, profesionalism, good references, and most importantly, we felt that we can trust to give him this big job. It turned out that this was a wise choice. During the interviewing process, Mike provided to us with a list of sub-contractors; all of them he had worked with before. He helped to clarify our requirements and to negotiate pricing. We picked most of the subs from this list. At the end all of them proved that they had good workmanship and high work-ethics."

        "A friend recommend Mike Sakkestad to us for our kitchen remodel and we're very happy they did. He showed up on time, got back to us with a very reasonable quote, started the project on time and left us with a very beautiful kitchen. He has great subcontractors including his wife who can paint faux designs. Very trustworthy, willing to do what it takes to make it right and can offer advice when needed. Just tell him what you want and he'll deliver it."
